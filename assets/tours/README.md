## Tours

This folder contains the tours which are interactive tutorials.

### Foreword

The `tourGuide` API is not currently designed to be used by third-party node developers. If you like it, please let the NR team know so that it can be opened up. Consider the `First Flow` tour as a demonstrator.

### Content

- `First Flow`: helps the user to create his first Firestore flow.

### Telemetry

Anonymous telemetry data are collected to improve the user experience of the `First Flow` tour guide.
The data collected only contains the progress of the tour. No personal information or credential is collected.

To disable the telemetry, enter the following line into your browser console before closing the tour:

```js
FirebaseUI.telemetry = false
```
